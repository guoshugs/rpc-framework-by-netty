# RPC Framework by Netty

A lightweight RPC framework built from scratch using **Java** and **Netty**, simulating a simplified version of modern distributed RPC systems like **Dubbo** or **gRPC**. It demonstrates key concepts in RPC architecture including network communication, service registration, serialization, dynamic proxies, and modular design patterns.

## 🔧 Features

- Custom RPC protocol
- Service registration and discovery
- Netty-based network communication
- Load balancing strategies
- Support for multiple serializers (e.g., Kryo, JSON)
- Annotation-based service configuration


## 📁 Project Structure
- rpc-api: Contains common interfaces and data transfer objects.
- rpc-core: Core RPC logic including protocol handling, serialization, and transport.
- rpc-demo: Example client and server implementation.
- rpc-common: Shared utilities and constants.

## 📚Requirements

- Java 8+
- Maven
